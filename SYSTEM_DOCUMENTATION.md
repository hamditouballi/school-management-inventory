  - Low-stock threshold tracking with alerts
  - Description and unit tracking
  - Computed `is_low_stock` attribute for real-time monitoring

- **Request Workflow**
  - Multi-item requests creation by any user
  - Status tracking: pending → approved → fulfilled
  - Automatic Bon de Sortie generation on fulfillment
  - Stock deduction with insufficient stock detection

   {"status": "approved"}

3. Stock Manager fulfills request
   POST /api/requests/1/fulfill
   - Generates Bon de Sortie entries
   - Decreases item quantities
   - Updates request status to "fulfilled"
   - If insufficient stock → suggests Purchase Order
```

### 2. Purchase Order Approval Flow
```
1. Stock Manager creates PO (when stock low)
   POST /api/purchase-orders
   {
     "supplier": "ABC Supplies",
     "date": "2025-11-20",
     "items": [{"item_id": 1, "quantity": 100, "unit_price": 2.50}]
   }

2. HR Manager reviews and approves

   {"status": "ordered"}
```

### 3. Invoice Management
